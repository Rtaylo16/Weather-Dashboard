Weather Dashboard 

I have created an Weather App that with user input the user can choose the city by name and display the current weather with a 5 day forecast.

The user is presented with a icon depecting the weather condition

I have accomplished this through use of Jquery Bootstrap and and the Open Weather API. 

The User input is also logged inside the console.
